Verilog
>The digital RTL code, testbenches, results including output from pixelTop_tb (output.tiff) can be opened as a picture.

Spice
>The analog netlist and testbench.

Plots
>different results from digital and analog and some illustrations.

 
pixelTop_tb.VCD is not included since it exceeded github's maximum size of 100MB (1.8 GB)

This file can be regenerated by running "make psTop" takes 1-2~ hours. I made this simulation go faster by changing sizes of variables in the RTL models, but when I yosys reacted on some of them, so I changed those back.

The netlist for the pixelStateFsm is available as PNG, the netlists for pixelTop and pixelArray are impossible to realise as the pixelSensor module is not synthesizable. It is possible if one uses the SPICE netlist.
